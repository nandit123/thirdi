Who we are?
We are team Third I, a group of inquistive and innovative students, looking forward to make an ultra fuel efficient vehicle based on urban concept which can transform the transportation scenario in urban areas throughout the world. Everyone agrees that world needs to **rennovate things to reduce the pollution. So, this is the efficient solution we are giving for the world until we are able to become completely electric, which ofcourse takes a few decades to happen. So by these energy efficient techniques we can atleast last long on those fossil fuels and even conserve them.



Objective
We want to contribute in technological advancements happenning around the world and to achieve this we are going to use Shell Eco Marathon Asia(SEMA) as a platform. Now we aim to build an energy efficient car by bringing up the ideas of lightweighting and aerodynamic body structure, and set up benchmarking standards for energy efficiency in the field of automotive industry. We would like to lay the path for our future generations towards energy efficient transportation and a better world.
